        <p> Whether you work out at home or in a public space, you may be wondering if you can exercise after getting the vaccine, how soon you can get back to it, and how much you can do. We’ve got the answers for you below. Is it safe to exercise after the COVID vaccine?
The short answer is, most often, yes. No research has shown that it’s harmful to exercise after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The only safety considerations depend on your body’s reaction to the vaccine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the following common vaccine side effects. </p>
        <li class="advantages-item">No shower</li>

        <p> You may want to avoid moderate to vigorous exercise immediately after receiving the vaccine if you have an allergic reaction to the vaccine itself.

Common symptoms of an allergic reaction to the vaccine include: hives, swelling, and wheezing (a sign of respiratory distress). These symptoms usually occur within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine (3Trusted Source).

If you experience these symptoms, contact a doctor. However, if the reaction is severe, the CDC recommends calling 911 (1Trusted Source).

If you have a history of asthma or any respiratory issues, you may want to avoid vigorous aerobic exercise until you know how your body will react to the vaccine.</p>
        <li class="advantages-item">No smoking</li>
        <div class="Smoking">

        <p> Some studies found smokers to be more susceptible to influenza compared to non-smokers1, 2, 3. These studies were held among healthy young men1, 2and among a general population with a mean age of 44 years3, 4. Since 95% of the deaths due to influenza occur among people aged 60 years and older[5], we focused on the effect of smoking on influenza and on the efficacy of influenza vaccination in this age group.

Morbidity after influenza vaccination in the elderly was significantly reduced in cohort studies and in a randomized controlled trial6, 7. It is unknown if smoking in this group influences the efficacy of influenza vaccination. </p>
